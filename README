Imagelib - OCaml image processing library

Note: This library is currently experimental.  It is a (friendly!) fork of
CamlImages (http://gallium.inria.fr/camlimages/)

0. What is Imagelib ?

This is an image processing library, which provides some basic
functions of image processing and loading/saving various image file
formats. In addition the library can handle huge images that cannot be
(or can hardly be) stored into the memory (the library automatically
creates swap files and escapes them to reduce the memory usage).

1. Differences from upstream CamlImages

This library has a few changes relative to upstream:
* Build with oasis for odb.ml-friendliness
* Pack all modules under the Imagelib module to limit namespace pollution
* Features are all enabled without being able to disable any.  You can't
  disable PNG, GIF, JPEG, TIFF, XPM, Graphics or lablgtk2 support.  This is
  hopefully a short-term restriction
* A fix for monochrome TIFF loading from the upstream bug tracker
