CamlImages is an image processing library, which provides to the
objective Caml programmer a lot of image processing functionality.

CamlImages provides to the objective Caml programmer:

  ** basic functions for image processing and loading/saving various image
  file formats (hence providing a translation facility from format to format),

  ** an interface with the Caml graphics library allows to display
  images in the Graphics module screen and to mix them with Caml
  drawings,

  ** a freetype interface, integrated into the library:
  you can draw texts into images using any truetype fonts,

  ** a set of example programs, including gif animation, slide show,
  and a postscript converter to print images.
