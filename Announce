Version 2.12 of the CamlImages library, by Jun Furuse, François
Pessaux, and Pierre Weis, is now available.

CamlImages is an image processing library, which provides to the
objective Caml programmer:

  ** basic functions for image processing and loading/saving various image
  file formats (hence providing a translation facility from format to format),

  ** an interface with the Caml graphics library allows to display
  images in the Graphics module screen and to mix them with Caml
  drawings,

  ** a freetype interface, integrated into the library:
  you can draw texts into images using any truetype fonts,

  ** a set of example programs, including gif animation, slide show, postscript
  converter to print images.

Version 2.12 adds support for lablgtk2 and is also a bug fix release.
